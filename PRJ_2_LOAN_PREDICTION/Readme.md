<h1>LOAN APPROVAL PREDICTION</h1>
This project is a machine learning model that predicts whether or not a loan application will be approved by a bank. The model was built using Python and various machine learning libraries.
<h3>ABOUT DATASET</h3>
The dataset used in this project was obtained from a public source and contains information about loan applicants, such as their income, credit history, and loan amount. This dataset contains information about loan applicants, including their demographics, financial information, and loan information. The dataset has 13 columns and 614 rows.
<h3>MODEL</h3>
The model used in this project is a logistic regression model, which was chosen due to its ability to predict binary outcomes. The model was trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set. Various evaluation metrics were used to assess the performance of the model.
<h3>COLUMNS</h3>

Loan_ID: Unique Loan ID

Gender: Male/Female

Married: Applicant married (Y/N)

Dependents: Number of dependents

Education: Applicant Education (Graduate/Under Graduate)

Self_Employed: Self employed (Y/N)

ApplicantIncome: Applicant income

CoapplicantIncome: Coapplicant income

LoanAmount: Loan amount in thousands

Loan_Amount_Term: Term of loan in months

Credit_History: Credit history meets guidelines (1 = yes, 0 = no)

Property_Area: Urban/Semi-Urban/Rural

Loan_Status: Loan approved (Y/N)
<h3>Data Source</h3>
The dataset was sourced from a public domain dataset available on Analytics Vidhya, which is a data science community that hosts various data science competitions and resources. The dataset can also be found on Kaggle.

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
In this project, we developed a machine learning model to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not based on various factors such as applicant's income, credit history, and loan amount.

We started by performing exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables. We then performed feature engineering and selection to prepare the data for model training.

We trained a logistic regression model on the data and evaluated its performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Our model achieved an accuracy of 80%, which is a decent performance.

We also used a confusion matrix and ROC curve to visualize the performance of the model and find the optimal threshold value.

Overall, this project demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms to real-world problems and how they can be used to make data-driven decisions. The model developed in this project can be used by banks and other financial institutions to automate the loan approval process and reduce the risk of default.
