<h1>BREAST CANCER CLASSIFICATION</h1>
This project aims to develop and compare different machine learning classifiers for breast cancer diagnosis based on the features of the tumor. The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains 569 samples of malignant and benign tumor cells. The first two columns in the dataset store the unique ID numbers of the samples and the corresponding diagnosis (M=malignant, B=benign), respectively. The columns 3-32 contain 30 real-valued features that are computed from digitized images of the cell nuclei, which can be used to characterize the shape, size, texture, and symmetry of the cells.
