<h1>ADANI ENTERPRISES STOCK PREDICTION</h1>

This machine learning project aims to predict the future stock prices of Adani Enterprises based on historical data. The project involves the use of various machine learning techniques and tools to build a predictive model that can forecast the stock prices of Adani Enterprises.

<h3>ABOUT DATASET</h3>

The dataset used in this project is obtained from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India's website. It contains historical stock prices of Adani Enterprises from January 2011 to August 2021. The dataset includes features such as Date, Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume.The dataset contains details of ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED stocks from 18-03-2021-to-18-03-2023.

<h3>COLUMNS</h3>

Date: The date on which the stock price was recorded.

Open: The opening price of the stock on the given date.

High: The highest price of the stock on the given date.

Low: The lowest price of the stock on the given date.

Close: The closing price of the stock on the given date.

Shares Traded: The number of shares traded on the given date.

Turnover (Rs. Cr): The total value of shares traded on the given date in crore rupees.
<h3>MODEL</h3>
In this machine learning project, a Linear Regression model was used to predict the stock prices of Adani Enterprises.

Linear regression is a statistical approach used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In this case, the dependent variable is the stock price, and the independent variables are the date and other financial indicators such as the opening, closing, high, and low prices of the stock.

The linear regression model attempts to fit a line through the data points that represents the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. Once the line is fitted, the model can be used to predict the value of the dependent variable (i.e., the stock price) for new values of the independent variables (i.e., future dates).
<h3>DATA SOURCE</h3>
The source of the dataset  is the website of the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE), which provides real-time and historical data on stock prices and other financial information for various companies listed on the exchange.
